## Architecture Overview
Brief overview of the project's architecture, including the use of Clean Architecture principles.

## Steps to Implement CRUD Operations using MediatR and AutoMapper
1. **Entity Creation**: 
    - Define the entity class (`DeliveryAddress`) in the `Domain/Entity` folder.

2. **Abstraction Creation**: 
    - Create interfaces for command and query repositories in the `Domain/Abstractions` folder.
    - Update the `IUnitOfWorkDb` interface.

3. **Implementation**: 
    - Implement command and query repositories in the `Infrastructure/Implementation` folder.
    - Implement the `UnitOfWorkDb` class.

4. **CRUD Operations in Application Layer**: 
    - Define DTOs and models in the `Application/DTOs` and `Application/Models` folders.
    - Create commands and queries in the `Application/Features/DeliveryAddressFeatures/Commands` and `Application/Features/DeliveryAddressFeatures/Queries` folders.
    - Implement the mapping profile in the `Application/Mapper` folder.
    - Create handlers for command and query operations in the `Application/Features/DeliveryAddressFeatures/Handlers` folder.

5. **Database Setup**: 
    - Define the `ApplicationDbContext` class in the `Infrastructure/DataContext` folder.
    - Run migrations and update the database.

6. **README.md Creation**: 
    - Document the steps for implementing CRUD operations using MediatR and AutoMapper.
